    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve only seen proofs represented in Coq as\n",

    "rather inconvenient to manually construct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof values are most easily built interactively, using tactics to\n",
    "manipulate a proof state. A proof state consists of a set of goals\n",
    "(propositions or types for which you must produce an inhabitant), each\n",
    "with a context of hypotheses (inhabitants of propositions or types you\n",
    "are allowed to use). A proof state begins initially with one goal (the\n",
    "statement of the lemma you are trying to prove) and no hypotheses. A\n",
    "goal can be solved, and thereby eliminated, when it exactly matches one\n",
    "of hypotheses in the context. A proof is completed when all goals are\n",
    "solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tactics can be used for forward reasoning (which, roughly speaking,\n",
    "means modifying the hypotheses of a context while leaving the goal\n",
    "unchanged) or backward reasoning (replacing the current goal with one or\n",
    "more new goals in simpler contexts). Given the level of detail required\n",
    "in a formal proof, it would be ridiculously impractical to complete a\n",
    "proof using forward reasoning alone. However it is usually both possible\n",
    "and practical to complete a proof using backward reasoning alone.\n",
    "Therefore, we focus almost exclusively on backward reasoning in this\n",
    "tutorial. Of course, most people naturally use a significant amount of\n",
    "forward reasoning in their thinking process, so it may take you a while\n",
    "to become accustomed to getting by without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the keyword `Lemma` to state a new proposition we wish to prove.\n",
    "(`Theorem` and `Fact` are exact synonyms for `Lemma`.) The keyword\n",
    "`Proof`, immediately following the statement of the proposition,\n",
    "indicates the beginning of a proof script. A proof script is a sequence\n",
    "of tactic expressions, each concluding with a `.`. Once all of the goals\n",
    "are solved, we use the keyword `Qed` to record the completed proof. If\n",
    "the proof is incomplete, we may tell Coq to accept the lemma on faith by\n",
    "using `Admitted` instead of `Qed`.\n",

    "function types and values. Accordingly, we can use the `intros` tactic\n",
    "to move universally quantified variables and implication antecedents\n",
    "from the goal into the context as hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our current goal corresponds to a conclusion of some implication `P`,\n",
